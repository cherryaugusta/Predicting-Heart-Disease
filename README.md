# Predicting Heart Disease: A Supervised Machine Learning Analysis
According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) cause 17.9 million deaths annually.

The project utilizes the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) and employs a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to predict the likelihood of a new patient having heart disease. The dataset includes various features such as age, sex, chest pain type, and other medical data. Before building the predictive model, exploratory data analysis will be conducted.
